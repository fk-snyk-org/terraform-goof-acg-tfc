# Snyk Infrastructure as Code Demo

This repository contains a hello world example which demonstrates the Terraform features of Snyk Infrastructure as code.

It's specifically updated from the original to supplement deployment on A Cloud Gurus playground, but can be used for all other use cases as covered by the other terraform-goof repositories available. 

The accompanying Confluence guide for the full deployment can be found [here](https://snyksec.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/FBK/pages/1973944327/terraform-goof+deployed+in+A+Cloud+Guru+Playground).
